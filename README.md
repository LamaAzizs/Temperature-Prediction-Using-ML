# Temperature-Prediction-Using-ML
The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to analyze weather data in Riyadh and predict temperature based on several weather-related factors such as pressure, wind speed, humidity, and cloud cover. A linear regression model is used to achieve this goal.
